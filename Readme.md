# ASL Translator

## The Idea
Use machine learning principles to train a model that can correlate an image of an ASL hand sign to a letter of the English alphabet. Use the trained model to create a web app hat can translate ASL to English in real time!

## Training the model
I will be using this data set from kaggle to train my model: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet
